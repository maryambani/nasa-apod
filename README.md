# Generative Blog using NASA-APOD API

This project is a generative blog that pulls data from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API to dynamically generate blog posts. There is also a Favorites feature to save any articles of your liking.

The blog was built with Javascript using FetchAPI, Async/Await/ DOM manipulation and local storage. The challenge was to try to build the website using DOM manipulation as much as possible to create the generative blog where the articles change every time.
Node.js, Express and Axios were used to access the API key securely.
